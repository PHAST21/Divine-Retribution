## **About the Game**:

Divine Retribution is a game about a man driven by **Revenge** after he loses everything he cared for, all as collateral in the war between the gods and demons. 

Seeking revenge the man trains his body and soul, and **in death starts his journey**.

The first half of the game is a journey through hell, where he goes through the different layers, all controlled by an Archdemon. The demo shows the uppermost layer of hell, Haunted by the **Undead Guard**, and Controlled by the **Ferryman**.

Later onwards, multiple different characters would enter the fray, manipulating and influencing the Warrior's journey.

The second half would deal with the player journeying into heaven.

As he deepens his revenge, his soul grows demonic. This is seen in-game through the various mechanics that trade the player's power for defence when played aggressively.

As of June 2023, The game is still early in development and many different features discussed earlier are still to be implemented alongside more areas.
